### Explanation:

- **Python Code**: The Python script `ak47_cost_calculator.py` calculates the total cost for bullets based on user input for the AK47 rifle specifications (`bullet_price`, `bullet_capacity`) and the number of bullets (`num_bullets`). It then prints the total cost formatted as a dollar amount.

- **README.md**: This Markdown file provides documentation for the Python script.
  - It includes sections such as Features, Requirements, Installation, Usage, Example, Contributing guidelines, License information, Author credits, and Acknowledgments.
  - Each section is structured to provide clear instructions, examples, and context about the AK47 rifle cost calculator program.
  - Customize placeholders (`<repository_url>`, `<project_directory>`, `[Your Name](https://github.com/your_username)`) with actual details relevant to your project.
